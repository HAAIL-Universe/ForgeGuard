"""
planner_agent.py — The Forge Planner Agent.

This is the educational core of the entire agent framework. Read this file
and you understand how every Anthropic-SDK agent works.

THE CORE INSIGHT
----------------
A system prompt + tools in a chat = single-turn inference. NOT an agent.

An agent = a loop where:
  1. The model sees the full message history and available tools
  2. The model either calls tools (needs more info) or ends (done)
  3. If it calls tools, you execute them and add results to the history
  4. The loop repeats until the model calls the terminal tool or ends cleanly

The application code does nothing intelligent — it only dispatches tool
calls and feeds results back. The model does all the reasoning.

LOOP TERMINATION
----------------
There are two termination paths:
  A. write_plan(plan_json, project_name) returns {success: True}
     → clean exit, plan artifact on disk
  B. Iteration count exceeds MAX_ITERATIONS
     → PlannerError raised, no artifact written

Path A is the only valid exit for a well-behaved run. Path B means the
model got stuck (usually due to a bad system prompt or impossible task).

TOKEN TRACKING
--------------
Every API response carries a usage object. We accumulate across turns to
give you a total cost picture at the end. The cache fields tell you how
much the prompt caching actually saved.

Usage:
    from planner_agent import run_planner
    result = run_planner("Build a FastAPI task API with PostgreSQL and JWT auth")
    print(result["plan_path"])

# Model is read from env var so ForgeGuard can inject its tier setting.
# Defaults to Haiku for cheap flow validation; set LLM_PLANNER_MODEL in
# the environment (or pass model= to run_planner) to use a different model.
# FORGE_FORCE_MODEL beats LLM_PLANNER_MODEL — same override chain as config.py

# Real project plans (2-4 phases, 30+ files) can easily exceed 8k output tokens
# once narration + tool call JSON are counted together. Set this high enough that
# the plan_json is never truncated mid-generation.
MAX_TOKENS = 32_768

# validation failures and retries while preventing runaway loops.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. In this first turn, call forge_get_project_contract for ALL contracts in the
   manifest above — make every call in parallel in a single turn.
2. When you have read all contracts and have a complete plan, call write_plan.
   Do NOT call write_plan with a partial or incomplete plan.

REMINDER: The plan must be self-contained. The builder uses ONLY plan.json
to build the entire project — it must not need to ask clarifying questions.
